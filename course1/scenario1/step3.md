# CockroachDB Monitoring  with DB Console

## 1) DB Console 

The [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/ui-overview.html) provides details & metrics about your cluster and database configuration, and helps you optimize cluster performance.

### a) Access DB Console 

To access the DB Console with Killercoda.
- Go to the ```top right corner list icon``` next to session minutes.
- Click on ```traffic/ports```, this will open Traffic Port Accessor page

### b) Give access to external port using custom port
- Add `8081` in custom port and then click access.
- This will open the DB Console in another browser tab.

You will see all the 3 nodes you created in the DB Console. We will jump into the DB Console again in module 2.
