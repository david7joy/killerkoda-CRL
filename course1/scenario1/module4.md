## Module 4 : Play a Real Game NOW !! (Bonus)

This module is slightly different as here we want you to have some fun by actually playing a game called Cockroach Labs that we have designed to demonstrate how a real game uses CockroachDB. 

Follow the below steps: 

- Click on this link -> [CockroachLab Game](http://ec2-54-163-36-110.compute-1.amazonaws.com/)

- Once the game loads, click on `online`
- Go to `create account`
    - Create a `username`
    - Add an `email` and `password` : No need to add real email it can be a fake email and password should be atleast 8 characters 
    - click create account
- Change `find at least to 3 players` and click match
    - This will create a real-time match and put players into specific 3 player matches withing a few minutes.
    - Once that is done, click on ready to play the game and battle it out :)
